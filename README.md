### What do you need?

- node `v12.6.0` (You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily change between node versions).
- yarn version `^1.21.x` should do the trick.

### How to run the project?

- Navigate to the project root on a terminal window.
- Run `yarn && yarn start` if you are running it for the first time.
- You will be able to access the application under `http://localhost:8000`
